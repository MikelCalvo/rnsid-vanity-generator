# rnid-vanity-generator

## 📖 Overview

rnid-vanity-generator is a bash script that searches for vanity identities generated by **rnid** with specific patterns.  
It uses parallel worker processes, shows progress, estimates runtime, and terminates when a match is found.  
Upon finding a match, it copies the winning identity file into `result_id` and deletes all temporary files.

## ⚙ Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x rnid-vanity-generator.sh
   ```

3. Ensure `rnid` is installed and in your `PATH`. The script assumes `rnid -g <file>` generates identities, outputting lines like:

   ```
   New identity <abcdef1234567890...> written to <file>
   ```

---

## 🧩 Usage

```bash
./rnid-vanity-generator.sh PREFIX [SUFFIX] [WORKERS]
```

- `PREFIX`: required — a hexadecimal string (`0-9` or `a-f`) that the identity must **start** with (without `<` or `>`).  
- `SUFFIX`: optional — a hexadecimal string that the identity must **end** with.  
- `WORKERS`: optional — number of parallel workers; default is `4`.

### 📌 Examples

- Search for identity starting with `333`:

  ```bash
  ./rnid-vanity-generator.sh 333
  ```

- Search for identity starting with `dead` and ending with `beef`:

  ```bash
  ./rnid-vanity-generator.sh dead beef
  ```

- Use 6 worker processes for speed:

  ```bash
  ./rnid-vanity-generator.sh abc 123 6
  ```

## 🚦 Output / Behavior

- Each worker prints the “New identity <...>” lines so you see what’s generated.  
- When a hash matches the prefix (and suffix, if provided), the script:

  1. Prints `FOUND: <hash> by worker X`  
  2. Prints total attempts, elapsed time, rate (attempts/s)  
  3. Copies the identity file from that worker into `./result_id`  
  4. Deletes the temporary folder (`temp_vanity`)  
  5. Notifies the user about the file with the winning identity  

- To stop early, press `Ctrl+C` — all workers are terminated cleanly.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- `bash` shell on a Unix-like OS  
- `rnid` installed and accessible via `rnid -g <file>`  
- `flock` is optional but recommended for safe shared counter updates  
- Utilities: `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, `tee`, `rm`, `kill`, etc.

---

## ⚠ Limitations

- If `flock` is not available, concurrent increments on the counter may race (small inaccuracies).  
- Probability-based estimation: if prefix or suffix is long, the time needed grows exponentially.  
- For very large worker counts or high system load, `rnid` or the script may crash or slow down.

## 📦 Result

After a successful run, the winning identity will be saved in the file `result_id` in the project’s root.  
You can inspect it (it’s the file that `rnid` generated containing your vanity identity).
